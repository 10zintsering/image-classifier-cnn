Welcome to binary image classification system powered by Covolutional Neural Network

In order to build CNN, keras library is used which is built on top of Tensorflow.

The whole system has three parts: 

1) Building the CNN


2)Fitting the CNN to the images

3)Saving the model and loading it for future predictions


NOTE: For quick check on workings of the model, clone this repo and run cnn.py with provided Contants values in any python ide. I used spyder via anaconda navigator.

Once you saw the steps, you can run the model at recommended Contants values mentioned in the code. It will take few hours to complete the run, depending upon the speed of your machine, but once done the model is expected to work with around 90% accuracy. 

If you want to check the predictions on your pictures, delete everything in the predict_set folder and add your photos there. Don't forget the change the PREDICT_IMAGE_NUM constant to the number of photos you have just added.

Enjoy!  

It may have been a case of overfitting model. Model can be tuned and experiment with different contstant values in future.
